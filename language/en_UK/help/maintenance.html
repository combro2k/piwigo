<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p>To optimize page generation time, Piwigo uses cached
information. For example, instead of counting the number of photos
contained in each album at each page reload, this information is stored
in the database. In theory, this information should always be correct, but
sometimes an error can occur and cached information becomes wrong.</p>
