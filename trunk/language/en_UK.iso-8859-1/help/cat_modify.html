<h2>Edit a category</h2>

<p>Modify informations and options of a single category.</p>

<h3>Action links</h3>

<p>This page offers you link to modification page of parent categories and
action links :</p>

<ul>
  <li>jump to category</li>
  <li>manage category elements (if category contains elements)</li>
  <li>manage sub-categories</li>
  <li>manage permissions (if category is private)</li>
  <li>delete category (if category is virtual).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Move</h3>

<p>If the category is virtual, you can move it. Moving a category means
changing its parent category.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Access type</strong>: Permission management. If you make a
  category private, all its child categories becomes private. If you make a
  category public, all its parent categories becomes public.</li>

  <li><strong>Lock</strong>: The category and its sub-categories will
  temporary been disabled for maintenance.</li>

  <li><strong>Comments</strong>: Authorize users to comment elements of this
  category.</li>

  <li><strong>Authorize upload</strong>: Authorize users to upload
  files. This option is available only if category is physical (not
  virtual).</li>

</ul>

<p>You can also manage these options with multi-categories options
management screen (screens <span class="pwgScreen">Upload</span>, <span
class="pwgScreen">Comments</span>, <span class="pwgScreen">Lock</span>,
<span class="pwgScreen">Public/Private</span>, <span
class="pwgScreen">Representative</span> in <span
class="pwgScreen">Administration, Categories, Properties</span>).</p>

<h3>Representation</h3>

<p>The representant of the category is the thumbnail displayed to represent
the category on main page (<span class="pwgScreen">category.php</span>) when
a category contains only sub-categories (just as the root category).</p>

<p>There are 4 ways to set the representative picture of a category :</p>

<ul>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">picture.php</span>: in the action buttons bar,
  one of them let you set the displayed picture as representative for the
  displayed category. This button is available only for administrators.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Modify informations about a picture</span> in
  administration. This screen can be reach from <span
  class="pwgScreen">picture.php</span> or <span class="pwgScreen">Batch
  management</span> in <em>unit mode</em>. See the help of this screen for
  details.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Administration, Categories, Properties,
  Representative</span>. See the help of this screen for details.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Edit a category</span> (this screen).</li>

</ul>

<p>The representation depends on configuration parameter
<code>allow_random_representative</code> (see <span
class="filename">include/config_default.inc.php</span>).</p>

<p>In default mode (<code>allow_random_representative</code> set to false)
each category containing at least one element is represented by a fixed
element. Once set (at category creation), the representative changes only
when an administrator ask for it. If the representant is not appropriate,
you can ask to <strong>Find a new representant by random</strong>.</p>

<p>If configuration parameter <code>allow_random_representative</code> is
set to true, a category containing elements can have no fixed
representant. Just use <strong>Delete representant</strong> button.</p>

<p>If the category contains no element (but only sub-categories) it can be
represented by any element thanks to screen <span class="pwgScreen">Modify
informations about a picture</span>. The only option on the current screen
is to <strong>Delete representant</strong> button, after using this button,
no representant option to set anymore.</p>
