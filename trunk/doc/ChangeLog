	configuration parameters

	* elements batch management : element_set page becomes the
	frontend to element_set_global and element_set_unit, infos_images
	(after a long time of use) become deprecated : the more powerful
	element_set is used instead. Consequently, batch management
	concerns caddie but also "normal categories".
	
	* refactoring code in admin.php to include the sub-file (clearer)

	* caddie : function fill_caddie replaces the code in category.php
	and can be used in admin/element_set.php

	* caddie : caddie table is added in delete_elements function

	* elements batch management : in addition to global mode, a unit
	mode is added : ability to manage a set of elements, element by
	element. This screen is very close to the existing "infos_images"
	(which will soon disappear).

	* elements batch management : in screen element_set_global, the
	display options are displayed at the top as in element_set_unit

	* functions get_day_list and get_month_list moved from search.php
	to include/functions.inc.php : these functions are now also used
	in admin/element_set_global.php

	* elements batch management improved : ability to set the number
	of elements to display per line, ability to set {author, name,
	creation date} fields, ability to add and remove keywords, ability
	to take selected elements out of caddie

	* apply category name and element name separation in calendar

	* "add to caddie" link is visible only when categories contains
	elements. Only admin users can see this link

	* elements batch management : impossible to create a link between
	category and element that already exists

	* logical separation of category name under thumbnail and element
	name

	* application version is defined at build or release
	creation. This way, include/constants.php won't change at each
	build.
