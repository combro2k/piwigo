<h2>Remote sites</h2>

<p>Piwigo offers the possibility to use several servers to store the
images which will compose your gallery. It can be useful if your gallery is
installed on a limited space and you have a huge quantity of images to
show.</p>

<ol>

  <li>edit file <span class="filename">tools/create_listing_file.php</span>,
  by modifying parameters section such as
  <code>$conf['prefix_thumbnail']</code> or
  <code>$conf['use_exif']</code>.</li>

  <li>using ftp, place the modified file <span class="filename">tools/create_listing_file.php</span>
  on your distant website, in the same directory as your category
  directories (as the directory <span class="filename">galleries</span> of
  this website). For example, let's say that you can access <span
  class="filename">http://example.com/galleries/create_listing_file.php</span>.</li>

  <li>go to <span class="pwgScreen">administration panel, Categories, Site
  manager</span>. Ask to create a new site, for example <span
  class="filename">http://example.com/galleries</span>.</li>

  <li>a new remote site is registered. You can perform 4 actions :

    <ol>

      <li><strong>generate listing</strong> : launches a distant request to
      generate a distant file listing</li>

      <li><strong>synchronize</strong> : reads the distant <span
      class="filename">listing.xml</span> file and synchronizes with
      database information</li>

      <li><strong>clean</strong> : removes distant <span
      class="filename">listing.xml</span> file</li>

      <li><strong>delete</strong> : deletes the site (and all related
      categories and elements) in the database</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- <p>You can do all this by hand by generating yourself the <span
class="filename">listing.xml</span> file, moving it from your distant server
to you local Piwigo root directory and opening the remote site
management screen : Piwigo will propose you to use the found
listing.xml file.</p>-->
