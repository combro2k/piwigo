<h2>Users list</h2>

<p>This is the place for managing registered users properties, except permissions that are managed from other screens.</p>

<h3>Add a user</h3>

<p>Administrator can add users manually.</p>

<h3>Users list</h3>

<p>The list can be filtered on username (use * as wildcard), group or
status. It can be ordered by registration date or username, in ascending
or descending order.</p>

<p>This screen allows the management of several users at once, using different actions:</p>

<ul>

  <li>delete users (requires confirmation)</li>
  <li>change status</li>
  <li>associate or dissociate from groups</li>
  <li>modify display properties</li>
  <li>modify additional properties</li>

</ul>

<p>The target is the selected users (by default) or all users as displayed in the filtered list.</p>
