<h3>Representant</h3>

<p>The category representative is the thumbnail displayed on the main page (<span class="pwgScreen">category.php</span>) to represent
the category when
it contains only sub-categories and no direct element (just as the root category).</p>

<p>There are 4 different ways to set the representative picture of a category :</p>

<ul>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Picture page</span>: one of the action buttons let you set the current picture as the representative for the
  displayed category. This button is available only for administrators.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Modify informations about a picture</span> in
  administration. This screen can be reached from <span
  class="pwgScreen">picture.php</span> or <span class="pwgScreen">Batch
  management</span> in <em>unit mode</em>. See the help of this screen for
  details.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Administration, Categories, Properties,
  Representative</span>. See the help of this screen for details.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Edit a category</span> (the present screen).</li>

</ul>

<p>The choice of a representative depends on the 
<code>allow_random_representative</code> configuration parameter (see <span
class="filename">include/config_default.inc.php</span>).</p>

<p>In default mode (<code>allow_random_representative</code> set to false),
each category containing at least one element is represented by a fixed
element. Once set (at category creation), the representative changes only
when an administrator ask for it. If the representative is not appropriate,
you can ask to <strong>Find a new representant by random</strong>.</p>

<p>If the <code>allow_random_representative</code> configuration parameter is
set to true, a category containing elements may have no fixed
representant. Just use <strong>Delete representant</strong> button.</p>

<p>If the category contains only sub-categories and no element, it can nonetheless be represented by any element thanks to <span class="pwgScreen">Modify
informations about a picture</span> screen. The only option on the current screen
is the <strong>Delete representant</strong> button.</p>

<h3>Link all category elements to a new category</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Virtual category name</strong>: Name of the new category to be created, 
all pictures of the current category will be linked to the new one.</li>

<li><strong>Parent category</strong>: Where the new category will be, 
leave empty to create it at root.</li>

</ul>
