  <dt>GD version</dt>

  <dd>GD is the picture manipulating library for PHP. Choose the version
  installed on your server. If you choose the wrong, you'll just have errors
  messages, come back with your browser and choose the other version. If no
  version works, it means your server doesn't support GD.</dd>

  <dt>Width and height</dt>

  <dd>Maximum dimensions that thumbnails can take. Aspect ratio is
  maintained.</dd>

  <dt>Number of thumbnails to create</dt>

  <dd>Do not try to miniaturize too many pictures in the same time. Indeed, miniaturization uses a lot of CPU. If you installed Piwigo on a free provider, a too high CPU load can sometime lead to the deletion of your website.</dd>

  <dt>File format</dt>

  <dd>Only JPEG file format is supported for thumbnail creation. Thumbnails
  can be created only from PNG and JPEG pictures.</dd>
