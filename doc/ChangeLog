	* new feature : RSS notification feed. Feed generator is an
	external tool (FeedCreator class v1.7.2). New file feed.php

	* new database field : comments.validation_date (datetime). This
	field is required for notification feed.

	* new database field : users.feed_id (varchar(50)). users.feed_id
	is an alias of users.id but is much more complicated to find (50
	characters, figures or letters, case sensitive) : the purpose is
	to keep it secret (as far as possible).

	* new database field : users.last_feed_check (datetime)

	* new database field : users.registration_date (datetime)

	* bug fixed : no need to add the (unavailable) session id to
	install.php in the installation form.

	* modified database field : images.date_available become more
	precise (date to datetime). This precision is needed for
	notification feed.

	* new index : comments_i1 (validation_date). Might be useful for
	feed queries.

	* new index : comments_i2 (image_id). Useful each time you want to
	have informations about an element and its associated comments.

	* version 9.11 of mysqldump outputs database field names and table
	names with backquote "`" (didn't find how to take them off)

	* new function get_name_from_file to centralize the construction
	of displayed name from the filename

	* new function l10n which returns the corresponding value from
	$lang if existing. Else, the key is returned. This means that if a
	language item is not translated, the key is displayed instead
	(better than nothing).

2005-06-11 Pierrick LE GALL

	* errors and informations boxes : management centralized in
	admin.php, $errors and $infos arrays replaced by $page['errors']
	and $page['infos'], special management for admin/update.php (more

	* elements batch management : element_set page becomes the
	frontend to element_set_global and element_set_unit, infos_images
	(after a long time of use) become deprecated : the more powerful
	element_set is used instead. Consequently, batch management
	concerns caddie but also "normal categories".
	
	* refactoring code in admin.php to include the sub-file (clearer)

	* caddie : function fill_caddie replaces the code in category.php
	and can be used in admin/element_set.php

	mode is added : ability to manage a set of elements, element by
	element. This screen is very close to the existing "infos_images"
	(which will soon disappear).

	* elements batch management : in screen element_set_global, the
	display options are displayed at the top as in element_set_unit
	
2005-04-11 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick /at/ phpwebgallery {dot} net>

	of elements to display per line, ability to set {author, name,

	category and element that already exists

	* logical separation of category name under thumbnail and element
	name

2005-03-25 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick at phpwebgallery dot net>

	* application version is defined at build or release
	creation. This way, include/constants.php won't change at each
	build.

2005-03-25 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick at phpwebgallery dot net>
