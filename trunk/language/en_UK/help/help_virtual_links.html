<p>Photos are displayed in the category corresponding to their file
directory.</p>

<p>You can also display a picture in several categories, without duplicating
the file on your web server. Associate the photo to any category from the
photo editing screen (that any administrator can reach from the photo page
on the gallery side).</p>

<p>Virtual categories are based on this concept: they have no corresponding
directory. Create virtual categories
from <span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Categories &raquo;
Manage</span>.</p>
