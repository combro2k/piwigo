<h2>Synchronize</h2>

<p>There are 2 different synchronizations types : directories/files and file
metadata. Directories/files is about synchronizing your directories tree
with the album tree in the database. Metadata is about updating photos
informations such as filesize, dimensions in pixels, EXIF or IPTC
informations.</p>

<p>The first synchronization must be the directories/files one.</p>

<p>Synchronization process may take long (depending on your server load and the
quantity of elements to manage) so it is possible to do it album by album.</p>
